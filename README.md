# point2scrape
Web scraper that scrapes the Point 2 Realtor website and outputs csv with useful data

It outputs in the csv filethe following columns: ['Address', 'Beds', 'Baths', 'Size', 'Area', 'Acres',
'Price', 'Agent', 'Firm', 'Map', 'Contact', 'Picture','Listing Link'].

This is one of my first scripts that i have typed. I hope you can find it useful.
